# Two LANs Connected Using a Router

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates two separate LAN networks connected using a router. 
Each LAN is configured with proper IP addressing and default gateways to enable 
inter-network communication.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- TCP/IP
- ICMP

## 🌐 Network Topology
- Two LANs connected via a router
- Each LAN uses a separate IP network

## 📋 IP Addressing
LAN 1: 192.168.1.0/24  
LAN 2: 192.168.2.0/24  

## ✅ Verification
- Ping test between LAN 1 and LAN 2
- Successful ICMP replies confirm connectivity
